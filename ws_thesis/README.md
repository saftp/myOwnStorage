# This is your workspace folder
Every programm you use during your thesis should have this folder as workspace. 

If you use different programms or want to create a structure you can use subfolder.

Git will not add,commit or push an empty folder, there for at least one file has to be inside. 
Due to that,create for every folder a README.md file. In this file your shortly write the content of this folder. 
If you have any questions, contact me (saftp@rwu.de).
