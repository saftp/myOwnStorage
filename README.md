## Mangement of your project
Before you start with your thesis, it is important to have a good management.

Therefore you need to know what you want to do in your thesis. What is your main goal?

Divide the journey to you main goal in small goals and define milestones you want to achieve step by step.

For a good structure you need visual representation of your timeline.

One good tool for that is a Ganttchart. Discuss with your professor and supervisor the topics and content of your thesis.
Thereafter structure the content and create small subgoals.
Write this subgoal into your Ganttchart and also note, how long you want to take for that task.

After your created that Ganttchart, make a new directory in your doc_thesis folder and save inside.

Save the source file and as an Screenshot (png,pdf,jpg), where all task and dates are shown.
